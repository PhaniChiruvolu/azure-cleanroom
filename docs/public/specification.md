Full specification [here](/src/tools/azure-cli-extension/cleanroom/azext_cleanroom/templates/cleanroomspec-openapi.yaml)

The Clean Room specification describes the set of data sources and data sinks that need to be made available within the clean room, the set of applications to be deployed within the clean room consuming this data as well any endpoints that need to be enabled for communication with these applications. Additional configuration includes the code sandbox configuration details and details of the endpoints to be used for governance.

```yaml
Specification:
  DataSources:
    - DataSource
  DataSinks:
    - DataSink
  Applications:
    - Application
  Sandbox: SandboxSettings
  Governance: GovernanceSettings
```

## DATA

The Clean Room specification includes details about the data source(s) and data sink(s) to be surfaced - the type of the data source/sink, resource providing the backing data store, identity to be used for accessing the resource and privacy protection configuration.

```yaml
# Data related.
DataSource:
  Name: string
  Type: string # Type of the data source.
  Path: string
  Store: Resource # Backing data store.
  Identity: Identity # Identity to be used for accessing the resource.
  Protection: PrivacyProxySettings

DataSink:
  Name: string
  Type: string # Type of the data sink.
  Path: string
  Store: Resource # Backing data store.
  Identity: Identity # Identity to be used for accessing the resource.
  Protection: PrivacyProxySettings
```

## RESOURCE

```yaml
# Resource
Resource:
  Name: string # Name of the resource.
  Type: string # Type of the resource.
  Id: string # ID of the resource.
  Provider: ServiceEndpoint
ServiceEndpoint:
  Protocol: string # Service communication protocol.
  URL: string # Service endpoint.
  Configuration: string # Service specific details required for communication.
```

## IDENTITY

The Clean Room specification includes details about the identity to be used for accessing a given resource. These identities can be based on attestation of the compute instance (AttestationBasedTokenIssuer), presentation of a secret (SecretBasedTokenIssuer) or identity federation (FederatedIdentityBasedTokenIssuer).

```yaml
# Identity
Identity:
  Name: string
  ClientId: string # User.
  TenantId: string # Directory.
  TokenIssuer: AttestationBasedTokenIssuer | SecretBasedTokenIssuer | FederatedIdentityBasedTokenIssuer # Token issuer service.
AttestationBasedTokenIssuer:
  Issuer: ServiceEndpoint # Token issuer service.
SecretBasedTokenIssuer:
  Issuer: ServiceEndpoint # Token issuer service.
  Secret: CleanRoomSecret
  SecretAccessIdentity: Identity # Token issuer service - AttestationBasedTokenIssuer.
FederatedIdentityBasedTokenIssuer:
  Issuer: ServiceEndpoint # Token issuer service.
  FederatedIdentity: Identity # Identity to be used for federating with the token issuer.
CleanRoomSecret:
  SecretType: string # Key | Certificate | Secret
  BackingResource: Resource
```

## PRIVACY PROTECTION

The Clean Room specification includes details about the privacy proxy to be used, the protection mode – Secure/Trusted/Open, policy specifying any rules to be enforced and the secret to be used for decryption and encryption of sensitive data.

```yaml
# Protection
PrivacyProxySettings:
  ProxyType: string # Type of privacy proxy.
  ProxyMode: string # Proxy privacy mode - Secure | Trusted | Open.
  PrivacyPolicy: Policy # Proxy specific privacy policy.
  Configuration: string # Proxy specific configuration details.
  EncryptionSecret:
    # If both DEK and KEK are provided, then the DEK is assumed to be wrapped by KEK.
    # If only DEK is provided, then the DEK is assumed to be unwrapped.
    # If both DEK and KEK are not provided, then data is not protected and is in clear text.
    DEK: CleanRoomSecret # Data Encryption Key.
    KEK: CleanRoomSecret # Key Encryption Key.
  EncryptionSecretAccessIdentity: Identity

# Policy
Policy: InlinePolicy | ExternalPolicy
InlinePolicy: string # Inline policy.
ExternalPolicy: Document # Downloadable policy.
Document: # Self contained reference to document
  DocumentType: string # File | OCI
  BackingResource: Resource
  Identity: Identity # Identity to be used for accessing the resource.
  AuthenticityReceipt: string
```

## APPLICATION

The Clean Room specification includes details about the application(s) to be executed within the code sandbox. These applications are locked down and can only access the configured data source/data sink or communicate with each other through a local port.

```yaml
# Application related.
Application:
  Name: string
  Image:
    Executable: Document
    Protection: PrivacyProxySettings
    EnforcementPolicy: Policy # Application specific enforcement policy.
  Command:
    - string
  EnvironmentVariables:
    - string:string
  RuntimeSettings:
    Parameters []: string:string
    Environment []: string:string
    Payload []: string:string | string:DataSource
  ApplicationEndpoint:
    Type: string
    Port: int
    Protection: PrivacyProxySettings
```

## SANDBOX

The Clean Room specification includes details about the type of sandbox to be created for hosting the application.

```yaml
# Sandbox related.
SandboxSettings:
  Type: int # Type of clean room – 0 | 1 | 2 | 3. Currently supported - 0.
  Configuration: Policy # Sandbox specific configuration.
```

## GOVERNANCE

The Clean Room specification includes details about the endpoints to be invoked for meeting any governance requirements, such as runtime validation of consent for executing the application or presenting data or generation of an audit trail for all privileged operations performed inside the clean room.

```yaml
# Governance related.
GovernanceSettings:
  Consent:
    # Endpoints to be invoked for runtime validation of consent for executing
    # the application or presenting data to the application.
    - GovernanceService
  Audit:
    # Endpoints to be invoked to record an auditable event.
    - GovernanceService
  Telemetry:
    Infrastructure:
      Consent: GovernanceService # Endpoint to check consent for exporting telemetry events.
      Metrics: DataSink
      Traces: DataSink
      Logs: DataSink
    Application:
      Consent: GovernanceService # Endpoint to check consent for exporting application logs.
      Logs: DataSink
GovernanceService:
  URL: string # Service endpoint to be invoked for governance.
  Method: string # Method to be invoked on the endpoint.
  ValidResponses: # Accepted response codes.
    - int # HTTP status code
  Identity: Identity # Identity to be used for accessing the endpoint.
```
